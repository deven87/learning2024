a video recording can be done for all tests by adding it in config file

/*

use: {

    video:'on',
    launchOptions:{

      slowMo:1000

    },
    /* Base URL to use in actions like `await page.goto('/')`. */
    // baseURL: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000',

    /* Collect trace when retrying the failed test. See https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer */
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
  },


  // same can be done from test as well by using browser context
