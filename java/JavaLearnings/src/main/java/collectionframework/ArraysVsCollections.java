/*

always prefer to use array if size is known and fixed

as arrays are faster and support is provided internally from language itself

while collections are framework added, they provide a lot of support methods

collections are advised when size is not fixed

from memory point of view, collections are recommendedm but performance wise arrays are good

collections when grow, new objects are created and old object are copied to it so a long process

arrays can have homogenous elements only, collection can have hetrogenous elements
