        <td>  <br>this is helpful where the handling code is same for different exception, code reduandncy is reduced as not need to write same code in multiple catch blocks</td>

        <td>   <br>the exception class in a single catch should not be related with each other, as e.g. if parent child are there then there is no need for child
            as parent itself will handle child exception also, so the classes should not be related
