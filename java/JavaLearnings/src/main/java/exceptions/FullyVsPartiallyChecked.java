e.g. if you go to mall, you are checked but your child are not

similarly

when a class is checked and its child are also checked, this type is called fully checked

but when a parent is checked but child are unchecked, then it is called partially chcked

e.g. IOException is checked

its child are FileNotFOUND, INPUTOUTPUT, BOTH ARE CHECKED

so IOException is fully checked

Exception is checked but its child RunTimeException and its subclasses are unchecked

so Exception is partially checked


so only partiall checked exceptions are

throwable and exception

all other are fully checked
