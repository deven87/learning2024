            <h1> Constructors</h1>

           <br><br> // constructor are used to initialize objects with given values instead of default JVM initializations
            <br><br> // constructors have name same as class name
            <br><br> // every time an object is created, at least one constructor is called
            <br><br> // constructor can not have return type
            <br><br> // by default a constructor having same modifer as a class, e.g. if a class is public, constructor is also public by default
            <br><br> // constructor can be public, protected, private, default
            <br><br> // constructor can not be final, static, synchronized, native, strictfp
            <br><br> // constructor is called automatically by JVM when an object is created
            <br><br> // compiler will create a default constructor for every class, if programmer has not created any constructor
            <br><br> // compiler will not create default constructor, if programmer has created any constructor
            <br><br> // compiler will add super() statement as first statement in every constructor if you have not added super() or this() as first statement
            <br><br> // instance blocks can also be created which are executed before constructor and during object creation
            <br><br> // inheritance concept is not applicable for constructors and since compiler add super, child classes constructors call parent class constructor
            <br><br> // programmer can add super() in any constructor to call parent class constructor
            <br><br> // programmer can add this() in any constructor to call another constructor of current object of the class
            <br><br> // three type of constructors are there default, parameterized and copy constructor
            <br><br> // constructors can be overloaded
            <br><br> // constructors can not be overriden, as they are not inherited.
            <br><br> // parent class must have default constructor explicitly created if there are any other arg constructor, as each child will call parent class default constructor by default
